# Catch the Ketchup!
The well-known space company SFAC (Super Famous Astronauts Corporation) found an anomaly inside the Andromeda Galaxy: a gigantic quantity of food invaded an unknown red planet...They immediately sent out an expedition, but what they saw after is almost unbelievable... A PLANET MADE OF KETCHUP?!?

After various missions and studies about the invaders, it has been discovered that they're only vulnerable to... ketchup itself. They've sent you there to kill as many aliens as you can, prove yourself to be worthy.
