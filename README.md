# Catch the Ketchup!
The well-known space company SFAC (Super Famous Astronauts Corporation) found an anomaly inside the Andromeda Galaxy: a gigantic quantity of food invaded an unknown red planet...They immediately sent out an expedition, but what they saw after is almost unbelievable... A PLANET MADE OF KETCHUP?!?

After various missions and studies about the invaders, it has been discovered that they're only vulnerable to... ketchup itself. They've sent you there to kill as many aliens as you can, prove yourself to be worthy.

## How to run the game?
The game has been tested for Linux and Windows, works fine on both systems. To start the game simply run the "run_game.py" file. If the game doesn't start and the error looks like "cannot find file ./assets/textures", it means that the working directory is not the game directory. Else, open an issue [here](https://github.com/LorenzoPapi/FT-Pyweek34/issues) stating the error.
